TestWindow Issues and Questions

1. Message from TestFixtureSetUp failure is not shown anywhere. (Probably SetUp as well)
   This could be an NUnit issue as well.

2. Lose ability to get back to master list after running tests from failed window.

3. Where is the test log written?

4. How are the various outcomes handled by VS: None, NotFound, Skipped

5. NUnit error messages for equality failures display best using a fixed font.

6. Bar is green even when there are warnings/ignored tests.

NUnit Issues

1. Should we be sending test starts when executing?

2. Reporting any Message as ErrorMessage even in case of success.

3. Reporting Inconclusive as Failure. Should be None?
